## Environment Setup

### Manual Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/projectname.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```sh
   cd projectname
   yarn install # or npm install
   ```
3. **Setup Environment Variables**
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the actual values.
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env # use any text editor to edit the file
   ```
4. **Setup PostgreSQL Database**
   Setup a PostgreSQL database and update the `.env` file with the database credentials.

### Using Docker
If you have Docker installed, you can use it to run the application in a container. This will handle the database setup and manage the application dependencies for you.

1. **Build Docker Image**
   ```sh
   docker build -t cosmos-bot .
   ```
2. **Run Docker Container**
   ```sh
   docker run -d --name cosmos-bot -p 3000:3000 cosmos-bot
   ```

### Run as Daemon
You can use `pm2` to run the application in the background as a daemon.
1. **Install PM2**
   ```sh
   npm install pm2 -g
   ```
2. **Start Application with PM2**
   ```sh
   pm2 start npm --name "cosmos-bot" -- start
   ```

## Voting Wallet Authz Setup
This section will guide you through setting up Authz for the voting wallet.

Authz enables one account, the granter, to grant another account, the grantee, permissions to execute messages on its behalf.

## Setup:

### Grant Permission
Granter gives permission to the grantee by creating an authorization using MsgGrant.

```bash
gaiad tx authz grant [grantee_address] generic --from [granter_key_name] --msg-type /cosmos.gov.v1beta1.MsgVote
```

### Revocation:
Revoke Permission: Granter can revoke the authorization granted using MsgRevoke.

```bash
gaiad tx authz revoke [granter_addr] /cosmos.gov.v1beta1.MsgVote --from [granter_key_name]
```
